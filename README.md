[Stattr](https://rubygems.org/gems/stattr "Stattr") is a Gem that looks to help people who are writing programs and apps based on Tabletop Role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and more! It includes a number of classes and functions to assist you in your app-building.

Currently updating to a more formal Doc structure. For now, the key elements:

**Stattr::Dice** 
---------------
A Class of objects representing dice. Calling Dice.roll(6, 3) will roll 3 six-sided dice. 

**Stattr::Statlist** 
---------------------
A class that generates a list of stats and modifiers, based currently on D+D rules. 

**Stattr::Playerchar**
----------------------
A class made for extending. It takes a name for an argument, and automatically generates a stat list.
