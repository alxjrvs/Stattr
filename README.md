#Stattr#
======

[Stattr](https://rubygems.org/gems/stattr "Stattr") is a Gem that looks to help people who are writing programs and apps based on Tabletop Role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and more! It includes a number of classes and functions to assist you in your app-building. 

Stattr is under the MIT Open Source License. For more information, see LICENSE.md.


**Made for All Games**
======================

The *Game* class is made for redefining the base mechanics of the game. As it stands, the Game defaults to D+D 4th edition rules - character creation is a result of rolling 3 six-sided dice. However, feel free to re-write and redefine this in any application you use - writing new "def stats" functions will let you change these defaults.
